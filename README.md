How to Run Michael's Visualisation \
•	Ensure you are connected to the Github which has all of the data which is used in the graph \
•	Go to “Michael’s Visualisation” branch to find my own visualisation \
•	Load up my visualisation code \
•	Then run the code \
•	This should then load the scatter graph rather quickly
